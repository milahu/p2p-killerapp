my search for the perfect peer to peer app



## wanted specs



### efficient protocol

binary protocol based on flatbuffers

flatbuffers is a quasi-standard for efficient binary protocols

flatbuffers is a new version of protobuf (protocol-buffers)

text protocols are slow and verbose

the protocol should be machine-readable first, and human-readable second

the "canonical" form of the data should be optimized for high speed and small size.
this form is used for storage and transfer of data

from the machine-readable format, users can always generate human-readable formats, aka "disassembly".
but this case is rare, because most people dont need to "read the source"

bad examples

- JSON: nostr, ...
- XML: xmpp, ...

  - https://github.com/renostr/nrps/blob/master/nrp-1.md
- https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/515 - a stupid workaround to make JSON faster



### efficient implementation

fuck javascript

fuck java

seriously...
people who still believe that javascript and java are a good idea
should be kicked out from any serious discussion

bad examples

- https://github.com/Bombe/Sone - written in java
- https://github.com/nostr-protocol - based on JSON to make javascript happy



### transparent moderation

aka: transparent censorship

aka: censorship without meta-censorship

lets be honest:
there are no "neutral platforms",
because only dead people are "neutral",
and all life has bias.

there are only publishers,
and every publisher has his bias (or his jurisdiction),
so every publisher wants to moderate content

one problem with the current situation of moderation is
that the current moderation is not transparent:
content is removed and leaves no trace,
aka "censorship" and "meta-censorship" (censoring the process of censorship)

to get "transparent moderation"
publisher must have the freedom to remove contents
but they must leave a trace (the metadata of the contents)
so the censored content can be found on a different publisher
who has decided "this content is legal in my domain"

publishers can decide to block all content by default, and only publish the metadata.
in this stage, the content is "unreviewed and blocked".
when the publisher has reviewed the content,
he can either publish the content as "reviewed and accepted",
or explicitly mark the content as "reviewed and blocked",
or leave the content as "unreviewed and blocked"

the metadata has no human-readable information,
so it is always safe to publish the metadata.
usually, this is a sha256-checksum and a signature of that checksum,
like in the nostr protocol.
the metadata also should have a pointer to the previous event,
so everyone can see the full [chain of events](#chain-of-events)

the censored content looks like a [censor bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censor_bars) in a censored paper document,
so that at least you can see that there was some content, but it was removed

see also [redaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction)

<blockquote>

Redaction or sanitization is the process of
removing sensitive information from a document
so that it may be distributed to a broader audience.

It is intended to allow the selective disclosure of information.

Typically, the result is a document that is suitable for publication
or for dissemination to others rather than the intended audience of the original document.

When the intent is secrecy protection, such as in dealing with classified information,
redaction attempts to reduce the document's classification level, possibly yielding an unclassified document.

When the intent is privacy protection, it is often called data anonymization.

</blockquote>

bad examples? virtually every app fails here.
either the moderation is too aggressive (censorship),
or the moderation is too permissive (no separation between metadata and content)

https://www.cato.org/briefing-paper/shining-light-censorship-how-transparency-can-curtail-government-social-media

</blockquote>

As Ray Bradbury observed, "There is more than one way to burn a book,"
and recent experience demonstrates that the same is true of government censorship.

When most people think about government censorship,
they imagine the firemen in Fahrenheit 451 burning books
or the Great Firewall in China blocking websites.

But government censorship, at least in the United States,
increasingly occurs in a more subtle fashion:
government officials informally pressuring or encouraging private actors,
such as social media companies, to suppress the speech of, or deny services to,
individuals with disfavored viewsâ€”in other words, censorship by proxy.
This practice has also been colloquially referred to as "jawboning."

...

In matters of national security, law enforcement, and beyond,
government officials regularly make statements
that encourage private actors to suppress information,
and not all of this is objectionable.

Consider, for example, an FBI agent who requests that a newspaper
delay publishing certain details about an ongoing criminal investigation
because doing so could undermine attempts to capture the suspect.

...

There is an easier and more effective way to address censorship by proxy: transparency.

Federal officials should be required to publicly report attempts
to suppress Americans' exercise of speech and associational rights.

Censorship by proxy, as practiced today,
depends on secrecy and practical obscurity to evade public and legal accountability.

Forcing attempted censorship out of the shadows stands to deter
the worst abuses and ensure that officials who aren't deterred can be held to account.

### offline first

do not rely on the internet

this should also work over ad-hoc decentral networks

- LAN
- WLAN
- bluetooth
- NFC
- QR codes
- printing and scanning of paper documents

similar to

- berty
- briar
- ssb
- retroshare



### nomadic identities

this is required to give power to users

if some publisher censors my content or deletes my account
then i am in full control of my data
and simply can go to a different publisher
and re-publish (re-upload) my content there

similar to

- ssb
- retroshare



### chain of events

i want to make sure that i receive a full chain of events
from some peer through some server
and the server did not remove some events (censorship)

similar to

- git: chain of commits
- ssb: chain of events

this is missing in the nostr protocol

### compression

checksums and signatures should be stored in binary form,
not as hex strings, not as base64 strings

there should be ways to store text contents in a compressed form,
allowing different compression algorithms and compression levels

some content has better compression with bzip2,
some content has better compression with zstd,
...

the compression should not be limited to one compression algorithm,
and it should allow to add new compression algorithms in the future

### voting, tagging, trust

TODO



### aggregation of multiple sources

every peer can upload its content to multiple publishers

globally, there are many many publishers,
and i want to subscribe to the news feeds of many peers

but i dont want to use some fancy webinterface for every publisher,
like protonmail.com, which offers no IMAP server for free accounts.

instead, i want a "news aggregator" (RSS reader, newsreader) to aggregate content
from many peers over many publishers

this should be more efficient than RSS,
more similar to git, where only missing data is transferred from server to client
= incremental updates

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minds_(social_network)
  - Writers in The New York Times, Engadget, and Vice have noted the volume of far-right users and content on the platform, following a trend across social media.
    Minds describes itself as focused on free speech, and minimally moderates the content on its platform.
  - Vice criticized Minds in 2019 as a "haven" for neo-Nazis and far-right groups and individuals.
    In response to the 2019 allegations, the site banned several neo-Nazis and people belonging to other hate groups.
    Nathaniel Popper wrote for The New York Times in 2021 that
    Minds "became an online home to some of the right-wing personalities and neo-Nazis
    who were booted from mainstream social networks, along with fringe groups, in other countries,
    that have been targeted by their governments".
  - Ottman has said that he opposes removing hate speech and other objectionable content from Minds
    because he believes it can draw more attention to it,
    and that he opposes deplatforming extremists
    because he believes it only serves to push people
    towards more "other darker corners of the internet".
    In a 2019 statement to Vice,
    Minds executives expressed their belief that
    "free expression and transparency as the antidote
    to radicalization, violence, and extremism".

  If recent ecological disasters have demonstrated anything, it is the inadequacy of existing models and tools to provide efficient allocation of resources, access to emergency communications, and effective coordination of human effort. Few if any solutions exist that are off-grid, affordable, reliable, easily deployed, and openly standardized.
  disaster.radio addresses this problem.
- radicle
  - https://groups.google.com/a/monadic.xyz/g/radicle/c/ctR0tgua7Wo - Radicle, but using SSB instead of IPFS?
  - https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-alpha/issues/689 - We will be moving away from IPFS, and most likely also from the client-server architecture
    - IPFS, Dat, SSB all have immutable append-only hash-based approaches, but git already does this better than most of them.
      But this approach isn't the best for managing state.
      State needs to be mutable, and fast.
      Can I ask why you never considered [GUN](https://github.com/amark/gun)? We're faster than many centralized databases, yet completely P2P/decentralized and trustless (cryptographically secure).
